        <p> 
         The purpose of blood donation camp is to select a suitable donor whose 
blood is safe to the recipients and who himself shall not in any way be harmed by 
blood donation. Outdoor voluntary blood donation camps in India are organized in 
three phases. They are pre-camp phase, camp phase, post-camp phase. Conducting 
voluntary blood donation camp in regular basis will increase the stock of blood 
units in blood bank which is needed for optimum functioning of the health-care 
system. 
         The organization of blood donation camp should be best and safe to the 
patient/recipients and to the blood donor also. With increase in population and 
development of more advanced medical and surgical procedures, the need for blood 
is ever increasing. Only voluntary blood donors can help to maintain an adequate 
supply of blood to save the lives of those who in need. They are the source of 
safe blood also.
